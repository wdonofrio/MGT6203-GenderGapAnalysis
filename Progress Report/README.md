# Phase 3: Progress Report
## What is it? 
- It will be a detailed description of what you have done so far, preliminary results you obtained, adjustments to be made if any, and the work that lies ahead. 
- The document itself will be a text submission similar in format to the an academic paper
- Think of the report as a formal progress report to send to a manager who may or may not be totally familiar with all the details and purpose of the project. Take care to explain everything clearly and provide proper background knowledge when necessary.
-  It is alright to assume your audience has some familiarity with statistical models.
- Note that this is a PROGRESS report, it is ok if you haven’t done everything, yet we expect you to show us what you’ve done so far and what you plan to do.
- We expect that by the progress report deadline, you should have all intermediate data preparation finalized, and be working on preliminary modeling/model(s)
