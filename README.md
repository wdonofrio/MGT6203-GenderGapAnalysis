# Team-26
Team 26's group project GitHub repository for MGT 6203 (Canvas) Fall of 2023 semester.

# Getting Started
## Proposal, Progress, and Final Report
Begin reviewing this analysis by reading the reports curated, which walk through the team's hypothesis, process, and conclusions regarding this analysis.  
The reports should provide a detailed description of the entire analysis.

## Primary Resource (Software)
The supporting software that enabled this analysis can be found under [Code/](Code/MGT_6203_Project.Rmd), which contains all the software related to this analysis.

The program can be executed using the latest version of R (>= 4.3.1), and does require various packages to be installed. These packages are listed in the requirements.txt file of the project, however, the program will install the packages upon execution as well.

The program relies on the data being pre-downloaded into [Data/](Data/). If executing the program, please ensure the following csv files have been downloaded:
- [Glassdoor Gender Pay Gap.csv](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/ISYE6414-GroupProject/EcLAmbYMUlVFuwrWlm4mcyoB2SXh9vMfgVxovy5YyY6qqQ?e=PJXg6u)
- [Glassdoor Gender Pay Gap w_o outliers.csv](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/ISYE6414-GroupProject/EVqdCmROVfhOsqV1DaY4HxoBxymFGgtezgfLwI9F7DgE4g?e=v4ze1f)

A rendered/knitted html file is also provided [here](Code/MGT_6203_Project.Rmd) if the program cannot be executed directly.

## Supporting Resources (Software)
Additional software can be found under Other Resources. This section includes exploratory software that was not used in the final report, but was crucial for the initial exploration and review of this analysis.

## Visualizations (PDFs)
Visualizations used in this analysis can be found under [Visualizations/](Visualizations/).
